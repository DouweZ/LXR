____globals____
parameters - this is an array of all the parameters that are currently active in the front panel. 
these include all the settings for each voice. Each element consists of a value and a datatype. 
The datatype dictates how that parameter is rendered on the screen. It might be possible to move 
this datatype into progmem as it doesn't change. Right now there appear to be 255 parameters. 
Toward the end of this array are parameters that are updated based on the active step in the active 
pattern and voice

____interesting functions_____
menu.c:menu_repaint - this is the guts of the code that updates the display.


___modulation stuff___
There are 3 types of modulation
LFO - LFO's can target a parameter to modulate as well as a voice number (PAR_TARGET_LFO1)
Automation - sequencer modulation - per sequencer step, you can modulate two parameters 
(on that voice) actually looks like you could modulate on another voice too (PAR_P1_DEST, PAR_P2_DEST)
Velocity - You can modulate a parameter based on the velocity value (PAR_VEL_DEST_1-6)

These all use getModTargetValue which given a voice number and value (from the knob) will return a parameter number
that can be sent to the sequencer 

dtypes:
DTYPE_AUTOM_TARGET (PAR_P*_DEST) - uses menu_cc2name to get descr
DTYPE_TARGET_SELECTION_LFO (PAR_TARGET_LFO*) - uses menu pages directly to get desc
DTYPE_TARGET_SELECTION_VELO (PAR_VEL_DEST_*) - uses menu pages directly to get desc
